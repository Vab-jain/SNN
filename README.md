# Playground for SNN-Training

This is a personal sandbox for experimenting with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using [snntorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The repository contains a mix of `.py` scripts and Jupyter notebooks created while following tutorials from the official snntorch documentation.

The code covers basic SNN training pipelines, model definitions, and simple experiments on datasets like MNIST.
